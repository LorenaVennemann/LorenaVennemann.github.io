            My first major developer event! Swiss Dev Confederation 2025 was packed with exciting talks on 
            cloud-native development, AI, and OpenShift. I was particularly impressed by the sessions on OpenShift and AI topics – 
            a day full of inspiration and new technologies!
          </p>

          <h2>Highlights of the talks</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Burr Sutter:</strong> "Paving the Golden Path" – Insights into platform engineering and developer experience.</li>
            <li><strong>Kevin Dubois:</strong> Tips & tricks for Kubernetes native Java applications – from zero to production readiness</li>
            <li><strong>Simon Krenger & Team:</strong> OpenShift Roadmap & Community Insights</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>My impressions</h2>
          <p>
            The talks showed me how closely cloud-native development, AI, and container orchestration are linked. 
            All the speakers I highlighted delivered their sessions exceptionally well, and Burr Sutter was a particularly inspiring presenter.
          </p>

          <h2>Why such events are important</h2>
          <p>
            As an aspiring developer, attending events like this helps me learn a lot and meet many other people in the field. 
            It's a great way to build connections, exchange ideas, and see current technologies in action.
          </p>    

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
            Swiss Dev Confederation 2025 was a huge success for me: exciting talks  and valuable insights into cloud-native development, AI, and OpenShift.
            I'm already looking forward to the next developer event!
