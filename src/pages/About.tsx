          <h3>Professional Background</h3>
          <p>
            I am currently in my 4th year as a Software Developer Apprentice at SIX, where I focus on 
            building robust backend systems and modern cloud-native applications. My technical expertise 
            centers around <strong>Java</strong> and <strong>React</strong>, with a strong emphasis on 
            scalable architecture and performance optimization.
          </p>
          <p style={{ marginTop: '1rem' }}>
            During my apprenticeship, I gained valuable international experience working at <strong>Archr</strong> in Stockholm for one month. This opportunity provided me with insights into professional software development practices in an international setting and enhanced my ability to collaborate across diverse teams.
